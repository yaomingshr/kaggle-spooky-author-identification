__label__3 If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived."
__label__2 But still I read more in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos.
__label__2 I must get away from evil shadowed Innsmouth and accordingly I began to test my cramped, wearied powers of locomotion.
__label__3 He was, as it were, now awakened from his long, visionary sleep, and he felt some what like one of the seven sleepers, or like Nourjahad, in that sweet imitation of an eastern tale: Diana was gone; his friends were changed or dead, and now on his awakening I was all that he had to love on earth.
__label__1 He bears it to the river, but leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt; for it is difficult, if not impossible to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be easy to return for what is left.
__label__2 He was alone in the sky with this queer and very disturbing house; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that the wall stood flush with the cliff's edge, so that the single narrow door was not to be reached save from the empty aether, he felt a distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain.
__label__2 It was our design to sit up together till very late, and then watch singly till dawn in two hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; the inactive member resting on the cot.
__label__2 My indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and immediately with my pocket light or to try to assemble a band of squatters for the quest, was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush of wind from outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark blackness.
__label__1 Never imposing upon any one myself, I suffered no one to play the possum with me.
__label__3 A bubbling spring prattles over stones on one side, and a plantation of a few elms and beeches, hardly deserve, and yet continue the name of wood.
__label__3 They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?
__label__2 When one came to think of it, it was generally only rather young people who were seen about in public, and of these the oldest were apt to be the most tainted looking.
__label__2 But perhaps this was all madness.
__label__1 These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power.
__label__2 The air of death and desertion was ghoulish, and the smell of fish almost insufferable; but I was resolved to let nothing deter me.
__label__2 Did all of this perilous sense of imminence come from the formulae on the sheets he covered day by day?
__label__3 He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.
__label__3 Guard, I entreat you, a firm persuasion of my sincerity in the inmost recesses of your heart out of the reach of the casual winds that may disturb its surface.
__label__3 With fonder regret than ever, he clung to his memory; and gave it in charge to his son, if ever he should meet this valued friend, in his name to bestow every succour, and to assure him that, to the last, his attachment survived separation and silence.
__label__3 Sometimes it would be in a desart; in a populous city; at a ball; we should perhaps meet in a vessel; and his first words constantly were, "My daughter, I love thee" What extactic moments have I passed in these dreams How many tears I have shed; how often have I laughed aloud.
__label__2 Life had become an insistent and almost unendurable cacophony, and there was that constant, terrifying impression of other sounds perhaps from regions beyond life trembling on the very brink of audibility.
__label__1 What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead?
__label__1 "We had rather hot work of it, that you may say.
__label__1 This challenge being accepted, a small table is prepared for the antagonist, and placed close by the rope, but on the spectators' side of it, and so situated as not to prevent the company from obtaining a full view of the Automaton.
__label__1 He would scorn to employ those of another.
__label__3 They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding places.
__label__1 Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.
__label__3 No no me miserable; for love extinct there is no resurrection "Yet I love you.
__label__2 I had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face, but as I approached the body, I seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound, as though life were not yet wholly extinct.
__label__3 She answered that I was right, and might do with her as I pleased.
__label__1 And touching that mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously insists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew?
__label__3 She received these tokens of returning love with gentleness; she did not shun his company; but she endeavoured to place a barrier in the way of familiar intercourse or painful discussion, which mingled pride and shame prevented Raymond from surmounting.
__label__3 My friends, for Verney, I feel that you are my friend, do not endeavour to shake my resolve.
__label__3 Raymond had quitted the palace the night before; he had promised to grace the assembly, but he had not yet returned.
__label__2 They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipe.
__label__2 We only realised, with the blackest of apprehensions, that the apparently disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the Dutch language.
__label__1 What, for example, in this case of D , has been done to vary the principle of action?
__label__1 Yet experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant.
__label__2 It is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing, the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and twitching.
__label__1 Had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving home?
__label__1 I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory to my own understanding, for the very peculiar countenance and demeanor with which Mr. Crab listened to me, as I unfolded to him my design.
__label__1 Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all we were saluted with loud cheers which we heard with surprising distinctness and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs.
__label__1 Very good One, two, is this a good quarter?
__label__3 How refuse the offers of this generous friend?
__label__2 Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came.
__label__2 Well meaning philosophers had taught him to look into the logical relations of things, and analyse the processes which shaped his thoughts and fancies.
__label__1 I say, this occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a former conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at any time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, who for some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city, when his answer, if I mistake not, gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of Great Britain.
__label__1 Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.
__label__2 Dombrowski, frantic at the failure of his constant rat poisoning efforts, cast aside all thought of his lease and within a week had moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in Walnut Street.
__label__1 Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation.
__label__3 As the earth became more desolate, her difficulty in acquiring sustenance increased; at first, her son, who lived near, had humoured her by placing articles of food in her way: at last he died.
__label__1 "My dear madam," said he, evidently struck with my majestic appearance, for I had on the crimson satin, with the green agraffas, and orange colored auriclas.
__label__1 There are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption; the Bi chloride of Mercury is one.
__label__3 And since in the wide world thou remainest, why should I complain?
__label__2 God, what a rage I'd hate to have it aimed at me "Why did you do it, Birch?
__label__3 "Alas My father," said I, "how little do you know me.
__label__2 Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water, and saw that the grey rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it near the shore, was almost submerged.
__label__3 It will contain no reproaches.
__label__3 A short conversation passed between us, but the next day he again stopped at my cottage and by degrees an intimacy grew between us.
__label__2 He had come in an aëroplane piloted by the intrepid Lieut.
__label__1 But, of course, the chances are five or six to one, that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler, rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor.
__label__1 Our present incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary.
__label__3 Some few of the Lords Lieutenant who remained, endeavoured to collect the militia but the ranks were vacant, panic seized on all, and the opposition that was made only served to increase the audacity and cruelty of the enemy.
__label__2 The crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the huge, grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand could reach.
__label__3 "And were she," said Raymond, "I would not advise her seeing him.
__label__1 You must forget too, my earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.
__label__3 The very idea was generous and noble, but, beyond this, his unpretending manner, his entire want of the assumption of a virtue, rendered his act ten times more touching.
__label__1 The spectators being satisfied of this fact, Maelzel closes the back door, locks it, takes the key from the lock, lets fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round to the front.
__label__3 A truce to philosophy Life is before me, and I rush into possession.
__label__2 Previously indifferent to such things, I had now an unspeakable horror of them; and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display.
__label__2 His impassioned lectures in defence of Villon, , Verlaine, and Oscar Wilde were applied to himself as well, and in the short Indian summer of his glory there was talk of a renewed engagement at a certain cultured home on Park Avenue.
__label__1 Her utterance of the romance in Otello the tone with which she gave the words "Sul mio sasso," in the Capuletti is ringing in my memory yet.
__label__2 Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown.
__label__2 But as leaving time obviously approached I conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard, extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word "Innsmouth".
__label__2 In another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful to take with him Shang the blacksmith and Thul the cutter of stone as witnesses.
__label__2 Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him.
__label__1 "At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery fillagree card rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantel piece.
__label__1 Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation: but the contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be only a set of false teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bundle of billets doux from Mr. Windenough to my wife.
__label__2 But in that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this hell of confinement.
__label__3 She had never before looked so supremely lovely.
__label__1 He would not only have fled from the wharf, but he would not have permitted the boat to remain.
__label__1 "Ha ha ha he he he hi hi hi ho ho ho hu hu hu that's good oh that's capital such a wit But all we want just now, you know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time precisely."
__label__2 Their social contacts grew fewer and fewer, till at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about the estate.
__label__3 He was pacing the garden: his passions were in a state of inconceivable turbulence.
__label__1 The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold.
__label__1 I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that it had ceased running.
__label__2 Of these categories one seemed to him to include objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than the members of the other categories.
__label__1 My practice was this.
__label__3 I awoke half stupefied; I felt a heavy oppression on me, but knew not wherefore; I entered, as it were, the council chamber of my brain, and questioned the various ministers of thought therein assembled; too soon I remembered all; too soon my limbs quivered beneath the tormenting power; soon, too soon, I knew myself a slave Suddenly, unannounced, Lord Raymond entered my apartment.
__label__1 Now these peculiar movements of the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in meditation, and the ingenious Baron Kempelen would have adapted these movements were the machine a pure machine to occasions proper for their display that is, to occasions of complexity.
__label__1 I listened in an agony of superstitious terror but there was no repetition of the sound.
__label__1 Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story.
__label__1 This time, however, they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching.
__label__2 And the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks.
__label__2 The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence.
__label__1 The drops of moisture trickle among the bones.
__label__2 I had not seen him since that day, two months and a half before, when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage.
__label__2 No, it could not possibly be repaired that night, nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of Innsmouth, either to Arkham or elsewhere.
__label__1 Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it.
__label__3 Thus, losing our identity, that of which we are chiefly conscious, we glory in the continuity of our species, and learn to regard death without terror.
__label__1 Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead.
__label__3 Worst of all, his absence now from the festival, his message wholly unaccounted for, except by the disgraceful hints of the woman, appeared the deadliest insult.
__label__2 No teacher urged or guided me, and I do not recall hearing any human voice in all those years not even my own; for although I had read of speech, I had never thought to try to speak aloud.
__label__1 "I will explain," he said, "and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question.
__label__1 You have only to do so and then so so so and then so so so and then so so and then "Mon dieu Ma'm'selle Salsafette" here cried a dozen voices at once.
__label__2 He was more than ordinarily tender hearted, and he did not like the hideous screams he had heard in the ancient house just after the hour appointed for the deed.
__label__2 His wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension.
__label__1 The project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the public the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine, which was built under the superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne, at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in Wales.
__label__2 I can recall the scene in these final moments the pale autumnal moon over the graves, casting long horrible shadows; the grotesque trees, drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs; the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon; the antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky; the phosphorescent insects that danced like death fires under the yews in a distant corner; the odours of mould, vegetation, and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the night wind from over far swamps and seas; and worst of all, the faint deep toned baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor definitely place.
__label__2 And as I pronounced the last daemoniac sentence I heard afar on the moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound.
__label__1 The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water mark.
__label__3 With a beating heart she expected another visit, and when after an interval her chamber was again invaded, having first assured herself that the intruders were her mother and an attendant, she composed herself to feigned sleep.
__label__1 Most philosophers, upon many points of philosophy, are still very unphilosophical.
__label__2 In the tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyish white in the spaces between the purple rings.
__label__2 Some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip, and I found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes.
__label__2 Either he was born in strange shadow, or he'd found a way to unlock the forbidden gate.
__label__1 Why, otherwise, since it was about dusk, should she make a point of the haste?
__label__2 But before I could investigate there came a third impression which because of its irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of anything my senses might record.
__label__1 He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.
__label__2 It sounded so unnatural slopping like, he said that he didn't dare undress and go to sleep.
__label__1 I continued the story: "But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin; Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win; And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard."
__label__2 No railroad now B. M. never went through, and the branch line from Rowley was given up years ago.
__label__2 The whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual.
__label__1 I have just left the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience.
__label__2 Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain, so that all the visiting princes and travellers fled away in fright.
__label__1 Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible.
__label__3 He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel.
__label__2 Though the northward pull had not diminished, he resisted it as he had resisted the other pull, and finally found that he could almost balance the one against the other.
__label__1 His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen teeth in a human head.
__label__2 Whether he had imagination enough to wish they were empty, is strongly to be doubted.
__label__1 Who would dare " "The thief," said G., "is the Minister D , who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.
__label__2 You'd better thank heaven it didn't go further. . . .
__label__2 His own face was in shadow, and he wore a wide brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the out of date cloak he affected; but I was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me.
__label__3 "I had rather be with you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence."
__label__3 At length I saw him at some distance, seated under a tree, and when he perceived me he waved his hand several times, beckoning me to approach; there was something unearthly in his mien that awed and chilled me, but I drew near.
__label__3 Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.
__label__2 The material seemed to be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal.
__label__1 But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.
__label__2 "But that ain't the trouble naow that was only the start.
__label__1 At the expiration of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye glass which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul.
__label__2 How little does the earth self know of life and its extent How little, indeed, ought it to know for its own tranquillity Of the oppressor I cannot speak.
__label__3 He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.
__label__1 Having gone as far as possible in this direction, a sudden turn was made to the left, and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its former course, and still closely along the edge of the table.
__label__1 "Gentlemen," he said, in a low, distinct, and never to be forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, "Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty.
__label__3 Did we pass a valley?
__label__1 I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed."
__label__3 We past down the steep hill, and entered the dusky avenue of the Long Walk.
__label__1 No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon.
__label__3 I was sitting by my fire, the physician who had attended me ever since my fever had just left me, and I looked over his prescription in which digitalis was the prominent medecine.
__label__2 So now I am to end it all, having written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my fellow men.
__label__1 In the present instance, Eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up and presented to her. "Keep it" she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles.
__label__2 Then I thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building.
__label__2 To describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in music.
__label__2 He was getting an intuitive knack for solving Riemannian equations, and astonished Professor Upham by his comprehension of fourth dimensional and other problems which had floored all the rest of the class.
__label__1 I should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot.
__label__3 You will not follow me, for when I bannish myself would you nourish guilt by obtruding yourself upon me?
__label__3 A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.
__label__1 "But," said I, "the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever.
__label__3 But it was not so, I was yet young, Oh far too young, nor was he dead to others; but I, most miserable, must never see or speak to him again.
__label__1 Wyatt's two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls they were.
__label__1 For such follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief.
__label__3 The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.
__label__1 "So far as his labors extended?" said I. "Yes," said Dupin.
__label__1 But as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none to this essay, were I even to hint at half the variations, or inflections, of which this science is susceptible.
__label__3 And morning and evening my tearful eyes raised to heaven, my hands clasped tight in the energy of prayer, I have repeated with the poet Before I see another day Oh, let this body die away Let me not be reproached then with inutility; I believed that by suicide I should violate a divine law of nature, and I thought that I sufficiently fulfilled my part in submitting to the hard task of enduring the crawling hours minutes in bearing the load of time that weighed miserably upon me and that in abstaining from what I in my calm moments considered a crime, I deserved the reward of virtue.
__label__3 Her internal pride and humility of manner were now more than ever at war.
__label__1 I wish the composure but not the depression of solitude.
__label__3 He entered the churches, and foretold to the congregations their speedy removal to the vaults below.
__label__1 Could not make out the words of the shrill voice.
__label__1 In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.
__label__1 Before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.
__label__1 Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by opposition.
__label__2 It was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours, even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us.
__label__1 "Amontillado" "As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi.
__label__3 Then, as if pursued by an enemy, as if wings had been at her feet, she flew to her own apartment, she dismissed her attendants, she locked the doors, she threw herself wildly on the floor, she bit her lips even to blood to suppress her shrieks, and lay long a prey to the vulture of despair, striving not to think, while multitudinous ideas made a home of her heart; and ideas, horrid as furies, cruel as vipers, and poured in with such swift succession, that they seemed to jostle and wound each other, while they worked her up to madness.
__label__1 Pundit is the only conversible person on board; and he, poor soul can speak of nothing but antiquities.
__label__3 Posterity is no more; fame, and ambition, and love, are words void of meaning; even as the cattle that grazes in the field, do thou, O deserted one, lie down at evening tide, unknowing of the past, careless of the future, for from such fond ignorance alone canst thou hope for ease Joy paints with its own colours every act and thought.
__label__3 I cannot say with what passion I loved every thing even the inanimate objects that surrounded me.
__label__2 At last he woke in his bed in the crazily angled garret of the eldritch old house.
__label__1 The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed.

__label__1 It was found in the Bois de Boulogne at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery.
__label__2 What I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people died there in alarmingly great numbers.
__label__1 The true cause of the restriction is, perhaps, very different.
__label__1 The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former.
__label__1 "You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept.
__label__1 "Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional.
__label__1 When, deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was "the celebrated widow, Madame Lalande."
__label__1 THE "Red Death" had long devastated the country.
__label__3 It was not it is not a common infidelity at which I repine.
__label__3 The sensation is most dreary, to use no stronger term, with which one looks forward to passing the long hours of night beside a sick bed, especially if the patient be an infant, who cannot explain its pain, and whose flickering life resembles the wasting flame of the watch light, Whose narrow fire Is shaken by the wind, and on whose edge Devouring darkness hovers.
__label__1 When there is no angle in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse.
__label__3 He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not.
__label__3 "But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.
__label__2 Early in August the half expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of the d Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus.
__label__2 To my mind rushed fragments of a passage in Joseph Glanvill which has quoted with tremendous effect " the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus."
__label__3 He writhed beneath an injury he was unable to revenge; and he quitted England with a vow not to return, till the good time should arrive, when she might feel the power of him she now despised.
__label__1 The principle of the vis inertiæ, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics.
__label__3 I shall expect your return by to morrow noon."

__label__3 No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
__label__1 Hence the impression of concavity; and this impression must remain, until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to the extent of prospect, that the apparent parallelism of the base and hypothenuse disappears when the earth's real convexity must become apparent.
__label__1 My own case, however, was very different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time.
__label__2 As the men of Sarnath beheld more of the beings of Ib their hate grew, and it was not less because they found the beings weak, and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and spears and arrows.
__label__2 Toward the last I became acutely afraid of West, for he began to look at me that way.
__label__1 Do you see the stage box?
__label__2 Seizing the green jade object, we gave a last glance at the bleached and cavern eyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it.
__label__2 The villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard.
__label__1 Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for it.
__label__1 The most fetid and poisonous smells everywhere prevailed; and by the aid of that ghastly light which, even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by paths and alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very perpetration of his robbery.
__label__1 "Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the 'th,' as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t; since, by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part.
__label__1 This central orb, however, dynamically, should have been greater than all its surrounding orbs taken together.
__label__3 "Good God He is gone But tell how this was; speak quick" Her relation was short.
__label__1 We mean you no harm whatever.
__label__2 Still nothing occurred to reward my watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of apprehension.
__label__3 Adieu, my dear Margaret.
__label__3 Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
__label__3 Nor did this seem extravagant.
__label__1 "Four of the above named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it.
__label__3 You, who fancy that you can read the human soul, as your native lake reads each crevice and folding of its surrounding hills say what you think of me; king expectant, angel or devil, which?"
__label__1 To day I found an enormous increase in the moon's apparent bulk and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm.
__label__1 "Has no copy been taken?" he demanded, surveying it through a microscope.
__label__2 His feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position.
__label__1 "It is," said Dupin; "and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.'
__label__3 My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.
__label__3 The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view.
__label__1 The voice said "Ha ha ha he he a very good joke indeed an excellent jest.
__label__3 I could be found in no state of mind which I would not willingly have exchanged for nothingness.
__label__2 My first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns the act of pausing with Warren before a certain half obliterated sepulchre, and of throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying.
__label__2 Presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy.
__label__2 With one savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far below.
__label__1 He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention.
__label__3 She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.
__label__3 Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.
__label__2 For a moment I kept sight of the glow of his lantern, and heard the rustle of the wire as he laid it down after him; but the glow soon disappeared abruptly, as if a turn in the stone staircase had been encountered, and the sound died away almost as quickly.
__label__1 This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon.
__label__3 We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.
__label__3 Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
__label__2 Manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments, and eager to refute them, having that confidence in his own opinions which had doubtless caused his success as a teacher; whilst I was too sure of my ground to fear defeat.
__label__2 A moment later came the titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts; blasting that accursed house of unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my mind.
__label__1 I wish to God my young and talented friend Chiponchipino, the sculptor, had but seen the legs of Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith.
__label__2 They were never heard of again.
__label__1 ABOUT twelve o'clock, one night in the month of October, and during the chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen belonging to the crew of the "Free and Easy," a trading schooner plying between Sluys and the Thames, and then at anchor in that river, were much astonished to find themselves seated in the tap room of an ale house in the parish of St. Andrews, London which ale house bore for sign the portraiture of a "Jolly Tar."
__label__1 There was, I knew, not a second to be lost.
__label__2 We had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial, and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed.
__label__1 VALDEMAR I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber.
__label__3 This account may be taken as a sample of my intercourse with Lord Raymond.
__label__1 It was the beating of the old man's heart.
__label__2 Upon returning home I went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed in vain.
__label__3 The forest glades, the ferny dells, and lawny uplands, the cultivated and cheerful country spread around the silver pathway of ancient Thames, all earth, air, and wave, took up one choral voice, inspired by memory, instinct with plaintive regret.
__label__3 But I forget myself, my tale is yet untold.
__label__1 "Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.
__label__1 It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction.
__label__1 With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them.
__label__1 When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right.
__label__1 She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all.
__label__1 The lady lived; and with redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration.
__label__2 They know it's a goin' aout, an' dun't calc'late to miss it.
__label__1 'Tis berry hebby bug.
__label__2 Many of the crowded family degenerated, moved across the valley, and merged with the mongrel population which was later to produce the pitiful squatters.
__label__1 Yet, strange to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial, although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance.
__label__1 Then the dandy swore very much, and looked about for a boot black.
__label__3 And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides.
__label__1 Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and once oh, but once only I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.
__label__2 He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again.
__label__2 Instead, his surroundings depressed him; and he frequently wrote to a friend in Albany of plans to leave the paternal roof.
__label__2 The urge to walk was gradually changing to an urge to leap mystically into space, and suddenly he realised just where the source of the pull lay.
__label__3 CHAPTER I. HEAR YOU not the rushing sound of the coming tempest?
__label__1 We may, however, presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of especial state.
__label__3 When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
__label__2 I had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets.
__label__1 This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation.
__label__3 On the first approach of his disorder, he travelled about from one place to another; until, arriving at that romantic seclusion he refused to quit it, and we made arrangements with the Duke for his continuing there."
__label__3 His kingdom was the heart of Perdita, his subjects her thoughts; by her he was loved, respected as a superior being, obeyed, waited on.
__label__2 Awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist, I stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel before me.
__label__2 The disposition of Old Bugs was as odd as his aspect.
__label__1 The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the body of Rowena.
__label__1 This request must I confess it?
__label__2 I told them of my dream, but they were not interested till I spoke of the weird sounds I thought I had heard.
__label__1 Up to his discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain.
__label__2 There was a factory inspector who stopped at the Gilman a couple of years ago, and he had a lot of unpleasant hints about the place.
__label__3 It seemed to me impossible that she could recognise the sound, but she persisted in her assertion till she gained credit with the crowd about.
__label__2 Desire to avoid needless explanations in case of unexpected police intrusions prompted these plans for a quiet and unostentatious departure.
__label__2 God knows how many there were there must have been thousands.
__label__2 Tall and fairly handsome, with a sort of weird Eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion, Robert Jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator.
__label__2 This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest.
__label__1 But assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.
__label__2 Though of poetic rather than scientific temperament, he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in African ethnology and antiquities, utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection of Sir Wade.
__label__2 At a.m. the next day I commenced digging.
__label__2 Simple animals they were, gently descending the evolutionary scale because of their unfortunate ancestry and stultifying isolation.
__label__1 I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air.
__label__1 His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self satisfaction, much heightened by the owner's habit of licking them at intervals.
__label__1 The eyes roll unnaturally in the head, without any corresponding motions of the lids or brows.
__label__2 The ridged, barrel shaped centre, the thin, radiating arms, the knobs at each end, and the flat, slightly outward curving starfish arms spreading from those knobs all were there.
__label__2 Whether or not he will ever come back, I cannot say.
__label__1 That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue and vividly blue were its windows.
__label__1 Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend.
__label__3 He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
__label__2 That, I s'pose, was because gov'munt draft men was in taown arter 'sixty three.
__label__3 At first, I had spoken only to those nearest me; but the whole assembly gathered about me, and I found that I was listened to by all.
__label__3 But, O, Lionel a kingdom is a word of might, and gently sounding are the terms that compose the style of royalty.
__label__3 Such were the strange and incredible events, that finally brought about my union with the sister of my best friend, with my adored Idris.
__label__1 It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration.
__label__3 There were no carriages, and grass had sprung high in the streets; the houses had a desolate look; most of the shutters were closed; and there was a ghast and frightened stare in the persons I met, very different from the usual business like demeanour of the Londoners.
__label__1 The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it.
__label__2 The floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious, and great lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like Druid monoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove.
__label__1 When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar.
__label__3 I have a friend who loves me as his life, and in whose breast I should infix a mortal sting if I ungratefully left him.
__label__2 But I do not fear him now, for I suspect that he has known horrors beyond my ken.
__label__2 In a moment I understood that he meant to open the hatch and plunge with me into the water outside, a vagary of suicidal and homicidal mania for which I was scarcely prepared.
__label__2 And now he was equally resentful of awaking, for he had found his fabulous city after forty weary years.
__label__3 She had to play the part of a courteous hostess; to attend to all; to shine the focus of enjoyment and grace.
__label__1 I longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing.
__label__3 I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.
__label__1 This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in possession.
__label__3 He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.
__label__3 My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.
__label__1 They alone would have amply established her identity.
__label__3 He accused me of melancholy, of ill humour and envy.
__label__2 As I hurried home through those narrow, winding, mist choked waterfront streets I had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet.
__label__3 Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret.
__label__1 He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and he fell dead within the car.
__label__3 Her head lay on my shoulder, her breath waved my hair, her heart beat near mine, transport made me tremble, blinded me, annihilated me till a suppressed groan, bursting from her lips, the chattering of her teeth, which she strove vainly to subdue, and all the signs of suffering she evinced, recalled me to the necessity of speed and succour.
__label__1 We have passed over some twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds, and all seem to be delightfully astonished.
__label__1 On the morning of the first day of the next month, the landlady does not present her bill, according to promise a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely, could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two for that purpose.
__label__1 And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words?
__label__2 Crazed as I was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance a nauseous, unbelievable caricature a blasphemous effigy of him who had been Denys Barry.
__label__1 Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings, than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought, pervading even his most trivial actions intruding upon his moments of dalliance and interweaving itself with his very flashes of merriment like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.
__label__1 If, indeed, the casting of large lenses were all that is required, man's ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task, and we might have them of any size demanded.
__label__2 But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies.
__label__1 This power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection this faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone but in every variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic intelligences.
__label__2 He evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be confined to his bed.
__label__1 When reason returned with the morning when I had slept off the fumes of the night's debauch I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched.
__label__1 But perhaps you do not comprehend me.
__label__3 I am prepared, so that I leave behind a trail of light so radiant, that my worst enemies cannot cloud it.
__label__3 She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
__label__1 For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.
__label__3 By the time that she had with uneasy thoughts laid her fair cheek upon her pillow, her mother's servant brought a draught; a suspicion again crossed her at this novel proceeding, sufficiently alarming to determine her not to take the potion; but dislike of contention, and a wish to discover whether there was any just foundation for her conjectures, made her, she said, almost instinctively, and in contradiction to her usual frankness, pretend to swallow the medicine.
__label__1 There was the President of the Fum Fudge University.
__label__3 The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called.
__label__1 A great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others.
__label__1 At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several serious émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs "for the conviction of the assassin," or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated, "for the conviction of any one of the assassins."
__label__1 Has lived in Paris two years.
__label__1 My sensations were those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at farthest, I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation.
__label__2 The later action of the government, after my frantic appeals, would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth; but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasi hypnotic spell of that ancient, haunted, and shadowed town?
__label__1 We still ascended, and now only one step remained.
__label__3 Posterity became my heirs.
__label__2 The man was great I say it even now, knowing as much as I do.

__label__2 The complaining ædile's own mother Helvia was a pure Roman, the daughter of M. Helvius Cinna, who had come over with Scipio's army.
__label__1 Could I resist its glow?
__label__1 By the by," she continued, "have you any recollection " and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek "have you any recollection, mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?"
__label__1 Having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs of animation.
__label__3 I understand your feeling," continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; "but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined."
__label__3 By a strange fatality Juliet alone escaped, and she to the last waited on her relatives, and smoothed the pillow of death.
__label__3 "There needs no persuasion," said the blushing Perdita, "except your own dear promises, and my ready heart, which whispers to me that they are true."
__label__1 For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation.
__label__1 However it might be just as well to roll him once or twice in the gutter, and then put him in charge of the police.
__label__1 How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb?
__label__1 But these garters are found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by Marie, shortly previous to her leaving home.
__label__3 I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
__label__1 My eyes, from the cruel pressure of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets.
__label__2 I did not like it, and debated whether I had better try to sleep at all.
__label__1 In attempting ourselves an explanation of the Automaton, we will, in the first place, endeavor to show how its operations are effected, and afterwards describe, as briefly as possible, the nature of the observations from which we have deduced our result.
__label__2 I cannot reckon the number of hours I spent in gazing at the sunken city with its buildings, arches, statues, and bridges, and the colossal temple with its beauty and mystery.
__label__1 To be sure, this composition was of no very great length but I "have yet to learn" as they say in the Edinburgh Review, that the mere extent of a literary work has any thing to do with its merit.
__label__3 "They built a wall between them and the world" Without, a thousand harpies raved, remorse and misery, expecting the destined moment for their invasion.
__label__2 The Boatswain Müller, an elderly man who would have known better had he not been a superstitious Alsatian swine, became so excited by this impression that he watched the body in the water; and swore that after it sank a little it drew its limbs into a swimming position and sped away to the south under the waves.
__label__3 Passionate desire of sympathy, and ardent pursuit for a wished for object still characterized me.
__label__2 The Emperors Tiberius and Maurice did kindly honour to his old age, and contributed much to his immortality especially Maurice, whose delight it was to trace his ancestry to old Rome notwithstanding his birth at Arabiscus, in Cappadocia.
__label__1 "At present we have not more than ten, altogether."
__label__1 I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors.
__label__3 After travelling day and night I arrived with an anxious, yet a hoping heart, for why should he send for me if it were only to avoid me and to treat me with the apparent aversion that he had in London.
__label__3 At length it was mentioned in the newspapers.
__label__1 I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.
__label__1 I searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment.
__label__1 I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.
__label__1 She had not returned my letter unopened.
__label__2 And always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein.
__label__3 At first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to such of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts on our fellow creatures.
__label__2 By this time two policemen had arrived; and Dr. Morgan, meeting them in the vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the stench filled reading room till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered up.
__label__2 It was almost a cliff, closed to all vehicles, consisting in several places of flights of steps, and ending at the top in a lofty ivied wall.
__label__3 Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.
__label__2 Snow would have hid the rails in any case.
__label__3 This ironical tone was discord to my bursting, over boiling heart; I was nettled by his insolence, and replied with bitterness; "There is a spirit, neither angel or devil, damned to limbo merely."
__label__3 Sometimes she looked at Raymond, as if to say That it should be so At others her countenance expressed I will still do all I can to make you happy.

__label__2 It soon developed that I had only a choice between different evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West Fourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had sampled.
__label__2 I did not open my eyes until the raucous clamour came loudly from a point obviously straight ahead.
__label__1 to promenade, as usual and customer brought home... JULY .
__label__1 that's me" here I screamed at the top of my voice "that's me e e I am Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart and if I havn't married my great, great, grandmother, I wish I may be everlastingly confounded" Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson formerly Moissart was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother.
__label__3 Thus I stood upon a pinnacle, a sea of evil rolled at my feet; I was about to precipitate myself into it, and rush like a torrent over all obstructions to the object of my wishes when a stranger influence came over the current of my fortunes, and changed their boisterous course to what was in comparison like the gentle meanderings of a meadow encircling streamlet.
__label__1 That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself momentous under any circumstances will be of service or disservice to mankind at large.
__label__1 Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una mine, mine, forever now Una.
__label__2 Vast, Polyphemus like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds.
__label__1 "What the devil's the matter now" said a second.
__label__2 I recall that I did not regard it as a common flashlight indeed, I had a common flashlight in another pocket.
__label__3 If manly courage and resistance can save us, we will be saved.
__label__3 But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.
__label__3 I extended my ride towards Salt Hill, on every side impeded by the snow.
__label__3 There was an eager delight in our tones and gestures that could only spring from deep mutual love joined to the most unrestrained confidence; and now the next day, the next hour, I saw his brows contracted, his eyes fixed in sullen fierceness on the ground, and his voice so gentle and so dear made me shiver when he addressed me.
__label__2 Against these assertions I have no tangible proof to offer, since my key to the padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of horrors.
__label__1 Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private.
__label__2 The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine.
__label__1 Our conversation turned, naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of poor Wyatt.
__label__1 Dreams are with us no more; but of these mysteries anon.
__label__1 With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration.
__label__2 And when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore of far lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown.
__label__1 I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor.
__label__1 Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.
__label__1 But even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay.
__label__2 Inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling, and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odour.
__label__2 He was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black clad body a strange rigidity.
__label__3 She never mentioned her father to Perdita, she appeared half afraid when she spoke of him to me, and though I tried to draw her out on the subject, and to dispel the gloom that hung about her ideas concerning him, I could not succeed.
__label__2 She had asked her neighbour Mary Czanek to sleep in the room and try to protect the child, but Mary had not dared.
