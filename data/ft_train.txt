__label__1 Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss.

__label__2 The shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the would be assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint.
__label__2 I did it for so long that life faded to a far memory, and I became one with the moles and grubs of nighted depths.

__label__2 Upon making this discovery I ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of resigned tranquillity came back as I gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night, when darkness calls forth what little of the past still hovers wraith like about, and old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through them.

__label__1 The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary discourse.
__label__2 At this point the thought waves abruptly ceased, and the pale eyes of the dreamer or can I say dead man? commenced to glaze fishily.
__label__3 The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.

__label__3 He is irrecoverably mad."
__label__1 While I remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so alarming, he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the bell rope; but just as he reached this, he appeared to have altered his intention, whatever it was, for he dived under a table and immediately re appeared with a cudgel.

__label__2 You know what a fiend he was for revenge how he ruined old Raymond thirty years after their boundary suit, and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a year ago last August. . . .

__label__3 Our native oak, as his partisans called him, was visited truly by a nipping winter.

__label__1 For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin.

__label__2 Over the valley's rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapours that seemed to emanate from unheard of catacombs, and by its feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausolean facades; all crumbling, moss grown, and moisture stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation.

__label__2 Once she hinted to the child Dutee of a somewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last moments, but he had soon forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar.

__label__1 One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it if such a thing wore possible even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.

__label__1 Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.
__label__3 I acted then, as I ever must, from impulse.

__label__3 Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves sights which before always yielded me supreme delight so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.
__label__1 This prison like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.

__label__1 "Where there is much show," he says, "there is seldom any thing very solid behind" an observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady's fancy, that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith, in her great family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon.
__label__2 But keep in mind that I didn't drop Pickman for anything like this.
__label__3 "There is more of what is specious than true in your distinction," said my companion.
__label__2 How could he be sure he would not land on that green litten hillside of a far planet, on the tessellated terrace above the city of tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy, or in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of Chaos wherein reigns the mindless daemon sultan Azathoth?

__label__2 Then I noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about the littered yards.
__label__3 In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.

__label__3 Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.
__label__1 It is not to be supposed that a lady, or gentleman either, has been leading the life of a book worm.
__label__3 Gradually the object of fear sank beneath the horizon, and to the last shot up shadowy beams into the otherwise radiant air.

__label__1 I now lamented that my great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish.
__label__3 I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death.
__label__1 I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend.
__label__2 The older fellows look the worst fact is, I don't believe I've ever seen a very old chap of that kind.

__label__3 In the same way, individuals may escape ninety nine times, and receive the death blow at the hundredth; because bodies are sometimes in a state to reject the infection of malady, and at others, thirsty to imbibe it.
__label__1 While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face.
__label__2 But still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear, which I had once more come to deem definite, material, and organic.
__label__1 The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated.
__label__1 Each animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following, very quietly, in the wake of its master.

__label__1 He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn.
__label__1 Here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout.
__label__3 His demeanour was sad; for a moment he appeared glad to see me and then he checked himself as if unwilling to betray his feelings.
__label__1 The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged.

__label__3 A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.
__label__3 Never did any woman appear so entirely made of mind, as the Countess of Windsor.
__label__1 But the case with which these variable fancies were entertained, and the very plausibility which each assumed, should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend elucidation.
__label__1 But my efforts were fruitless.
__label__2 Steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and looked about, stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced.
__label__3 I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.
__label__1 Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated.
__label__3 Late in the evening she entered the apartments appropriated to the festival.
__label__2 God knows what that world can have been, or where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and crawled through it; but whatever the baffling source of his images, one thing was plain.
__label__2 One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle's death was far from natural.
__label__2 As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window, groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village, and joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain.
__label__3 "Elizabeth Lavenza "Geneva, May th, " This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend "I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT" Such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.

__label__2 The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm.

__label__3 "Save me" she exclaimed, and would have sunk to the ground had I not supported her.
__label__2 Then thought trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than I had dreamed.
__label__1 Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted.
__label__3 Idris endeavoured to calm Perdita; but the poor girl's agitation deprived her of all power of self command.
__label__2 There was, too, the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediaries the quasi animals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches' familiars.
__label__1 "I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively.
__label__1 There had been nothing like order or arrangement.
__label__1 Mr. L l the student swooned.
__label__2 Then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried.
__label__2 My eyes, however, never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney; and I began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the woods outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall.
__label__2 The elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the Onga tribes near the field of his grandfather's and his own explorations, hoping in some way to account for Sir Wade's wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures.

__label__3 Cheers and loud acclamations followed the close of his speech.
__label__2 Meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of diabolic legendry.

__label__2 One canvas shewed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on Gallows Hill, whose dead face held a close kinship to theirs.
__label__2 She certainly knew nothing about it.
__label__2 What I saw was an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices; all of magnificent though unclassified architecture, and in various stages of preservation.
__label__3 At the turn of morning a gentle sigh from the patient attracted me, the burning spot on his cheek faded his pulse beat softly and regularly torpor yielded to sleep.
__label__1 When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel "Is the Automaton a pure machine or not?" his reply is invariably the same "I will say nothing about it."

__label__1 In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly teeth.

__label__3 The sky was blue above, and the air impregnated with fragrance by the rare flowers that grew among the weeds.
__label__2 And in the later watches of the night, when I went within the tower, I saw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when I had left it at the hour I sailed away.
__label__1 As night came on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive.

__label__3 "Is this your promised zeal?" "Pardon me," I said, "but even as you speak, I am gone."
__label__2 None of the non natives ever stayed out late at night, there being a widespread impression that it was not wise to do so.
__label__3 She refused with a smile, reminding him that for the present his sister had promised to be patient.

__label__1 And once but once again in the silence of the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying: "Sleep in peace for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora."

__label__2 I shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left.
__label__1 The lips were gently protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and repose.
__label__2 My liking for him did not grow, though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me.
__label__1 But he regarded me piteously with his large eyes and sighed.
__label__2 That was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream.
__label__2 The man did not accost me, so I hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn father.
__label__1 The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly Decay.
__label__1 My father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many years at the summit of his profession, which was that of a merchant barber, in the city of Smug.
__label__3 Again he thought, how during this long month, he had avoided Perdita, flying from her as from the stings of his own conscience.
__label__2 It doesn't seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy.
__label__2 As to the nature of our studies must I say again that I no longer retain full comprehension?
__label__1 By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon Beauvais.
__label__1 At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats.

__label__1 The crowd had departed.
__label__1 A postscript, however, mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.
__label__3 At fourteen and fifteen I often thought that the time was come when I should commence my pilgrimage, which I had cheated my own mind into believing was my imperious duty: but a reluctance to quit my Aunt; a remorse for the grief which, I could not conceal from myself, I should occasion her for ever withheld me.
__label__2 Horrified, he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime.

__label__2 A swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight, and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapour.
__label__1 I regarded the sweet mouth.
__label__2 At the same time the wolfish wind rose to daemoniac crescendoes of ululation.
__label__2 We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted Crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with peculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible and opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair of military flame throwers of the sort used in the world war, in case it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction for like the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were prepared to burn the thing's heart out if heart existed to burn.

__label__1 From the swarming streets to the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface.
__label__2 Fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up; and they were grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered to get rid of the thing quietly for a purpose I knew too well.
__label__2 And that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end; for upon the city in the valley I saw a pestilence descend, and then a frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left unburied only the temple of Artemis on the high peak, where the aged moon priestess Cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver head.
__label__1 "One" said the clock.

__label__1 In a few moments, however, it is seen that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of considerable volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way, with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight.
__label__1 The 'Hum Drum,' the 'Rowdy Dow' and the 'Goosetherumfoodle' must look well to their laurels.

__label__1 The day passed, and still he did not return.
__label__1 The vortex of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.
__label__2 He knew but a few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain.

__label__1 In truth, it was a dream like and spirit soothing place, that venerable old town.
__label__3 Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.
__label__3 Then weeping, she clung to me: "Take me to him," she cried, "unkind Lionel, why do you keep me here?
__label__3 When we arrived, after a little rest, he led me over the house and pointed out to me the rooms which my mother had inhabited.

__label__1 The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.

__label__3 This will I do, I said.
__label__2 When selecting the hill and building his mansion, Mynheer Martense had laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year; but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such phenomena.

__label__2 I was not sufficiently awake to see whether Tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel, but felt a distinct anxiety on that score.
__label__3 First I must seek Adrian, and restore him to her.

__label__2 My uncle's face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours, and I recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream.

__label__3 Frankness and social feelings were the essence of Raymond's nature; without them his qualities became common place; without these to spread glory over his intercourse with Perdita, his vaunted exchange of a throne for her love, was as weak and empty as the rainbow hues which vanish when the sun is down.
__label__1 What shall we think of a machine which can not only accomplish all this, but actually print off its elaborate results, when obtained, without the slightest intervention of the intellect of man?

__label__3 I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.
__label__3 The same half disdainful lips and smile of triumph, the same intelligent eyes, the same brow and chestnut hair; her very hands and taper fingers resembled his.

__label__3 But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it.

__label__1 It was deposited in Wyatt's own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife; this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor.
__label__1 Without pausing to speak of the "old saws," therefore, I shall content myself with a compendious account of some of the more "modern instances."
__label__1 This machinery is situated just beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is consequently easily reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his right arm brought across the breast.
__label__1 We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called "speaking terms," while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship.
__label__2 It had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes.
__label__1 In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.

__label__1 But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture.
__label__1 The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.
__label__1 He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, "Yes, I wish to be.

__label__3 "Yet," replied I, "nature always presents to our eyes the appearance of a patient: while there is an active principle in man which is capable of ruling fortune, and at least of tacking against the gale, till it in some mode conquers it."
__label__1 This canteen with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk.
__label__2 So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time.

__label__1 This done, let us compare these communications, both as regards style and MS., with those sent to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais.
__label__3 I I alone was the cause of his defeat and justly did I pay the fearful penalty.
__label__1 Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel.

__label__3 But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.
__label__1 He grins when his daily work is done when his allotted labors are accomplished at night in his own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment.
__label__2 I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them.

__label__3 Nov. th It is only four o'clock; but it is winter and the sun has already set: there are no clouds in the clear, frosty sky to reflect its slant beams, but the air itself is tinged with a slight roseate colour which is again reflected on the snow that covers the ground.

__label__1 From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; from these paintings vivid as their images now are before me I would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words.

__label__3 I owe this to Greece, to you, to my surviving Perdita, and to myself, the victim of ambition."
__label__3 As he walked through the wretched streets in the neighbourhood of the luckless Greek's abode, his heart smote him for the whole course of his conduct towards her.

__label__3 We had receded from the crowd; and ascending the steps of the terrace, sought the Castle.
__label__1 Now here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these communications themselves.
