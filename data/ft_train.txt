__label__1 Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss.

__label__1 Why did I rush upon my fate?
__label__1 In the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides.
__label__2 Of a possible natives who had inhabited this spot, not one living specimen was visible.

__label__3 She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.
__label__1 The rest of the shank was in the gimlet hole where it had been broken off.
__label__1 This prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the sun's rays by the moon's atmosphere.

__label__1 Its close resemblance to the medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too late.

__label__3 I clung to my ferocious habits, yet half despised them; I continued my war against civilization, and yet entertained a wish to belong to it.
__label__3 He requested me in the meantime to ride through the camp, and to observe and report to him the dispositions of the soldiers; he then left me.

__label__2 One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds I heard.
__label__3 In the face of all this we call ourselves lords of the creation, wielders of the elements, masters of life and death, and we allege in excuse of this arrogance, that though the individual is destroyed, man continues for ever.
__label__2 The shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the would be assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint.
__label__2 I did it for so long that life faded to a far memory, and I became one with the moles and grubs of nighted depths.

__label__3 She directed everything to be prepared for the continuance of their journey, and placing her lovely sleeping charge on a bed, passed several hours in acute suffering.
__label__1 Scarcely less savage was the "Lollipop," which thus discoursed: "Some individual, who rejoices in the appellation 'Oppodeldoc,' to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often applied has enclosed us some fifty or sixty verses commencing after this fashion: Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring Of woes unnumbered, c., c., c., c.

__label__3 I believed in her innocence; I knew it.
__label__3 Most men ruthlessly destroy the sacred veil, with which the female heart is wont to adorn the idol of its affections.

__label__2 There were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from the diamond window panes that it must have been kept very close to its antique state.
__label__1 Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.

__label__2 Upon making this discovery I ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of resigned tranquillity came back as I gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night, when darkness calls forth what little of the past still hovers wraith like about, and old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through them.

__label__1 Huge stones and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.

__label__2 His height had increased to more than seven feet, and shewed no signs of ceasing its development.

__label__1 Her face was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before mentioned in the case of the president that is to say, only one feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy.

__label__1 It must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon.

__label__3 The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.

__label__3 Our native oak, as his partisans called him, was visited truly by a nipping winter.

__label__3 I returned to Windsor at the wish of Idris, who seemed to think that there was greater safety for her children at that spot; and because, once having taken on me the guardianship of the district, I would not desert it while an inhabitant survived.
__label__3 "He is dead" said Adrian, as the corpse fell from his arms on the ground, and he bowed his head in sorrow and awe.
__label__3 I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.

__label__1 "Hem ahem rather civil that, I should say" said the bundle, in one of the smallest, and altogether the funniest little voices, between a squeak and a whistle, that I ever heard in all the days of my existence.
__label__3 I see the desolate plain covered with white, save a few black patches that the noonday sun has made at the top of those sharp pointed hillocks from which the snow, sliding as it fell, lay thinner than on the plain ground: a few birds are pecking at the hard ice that covers the pools for the frost has been of long continuance.

__label__1 These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or to disgust.
__label__1 He was a penny a liner, and a buffoon.

__label__2 Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud.
__label__2 The whole attic story was choked with debris from above, but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before the inevitable razing of the decrepit structure.
__label__3 I felt the beneficial result of such excitement, in a renewal of those pleasing flights of fancy to which I had long been a stranger.
__label__1 We also measured the thickness of every book cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope.

__label__1 The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron.
__label__1 I saw I felt that I had perfect command of my senses and these senses now brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation.
__label__2 But still these shadows of my dream deride me.

__label__1 Evil thoughts became my sole intimates the darkest and most evil of thoughts.
__label__3 A second thought passed, swift as an arrow, into her brain; she rushed to the window; and a flash of lightning shewed to her the expected vision, her lover in the shrubbery beneath; joy lent her strength to descend the stairs, to open the door, and then she fainted in his supporting arms.
__label__2 Finally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the disused door opening from the cellar directly upon Benefit Street, preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than the dark stairs, ground floor hall, and front door could give.
__label__3 They only saw a poor girl broken in spirit, who spoke in a low and gentle voice, and from underneath whose downcast lids tears would sometimes steal which she strove to hide.

__label__3 My father was one of those men on whom nature had bestowed to prodigality the envied gifts of wit and imagination, and then left his bark of life to be impelled by these winds, without adding reason as the rudder, or judgment as the pilot for the voyage.
__label__2 I displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic, monkish lore over which I had pored in youth; and covered the flyleaves of my books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of Gay, Prior, and the sprightliest of the Augustan wits and rimesters.
__label__3 He is a soldier, a general.
__label__1 "Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault," said my friend.

__label__1 Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder.

__label__3 Thus coming nearer and nearer each other, the howls and shouts of the Irish increased; the English proceeded in obedience to their officers, until they came near enough to distinguish the faces of their enemies; the sight inspired them with fury: with one cry, that rent heaven and was re echoed by the furthest lines, they rushed on; they disdained the use of the bullet, but with fixed bayonet dashed among the opposing foe, while the ranks opening at intervals, the matchmen lighted the cannon, whose deafening roar and blinding smoke filled up the horror of the scene.

__label__3 The flames of the city bent beneath it; and the smoke and dust arising from the ruins was dissipated.

__label__2 And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.
__label__3 I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.
__label__1 There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity.

__label__2 Being more than a little piqued at the Incivility of one whose Celebrity made me solicitous of his Approbation, I ventur'd to retaliate in kind, and told him, I was surpris'd that a Man of Sense shou'd judge the Thoughtfulness of one whose Productions he admitted never having read.
__label__3 And thus the ill starred girl died a victim to my senseless rashness.
__label__1 Trepanning was accomplished successfully.

__label__2 The villagers of Hatheg say it is ill to climb Hatheg Kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but Barzai heeded them not when he came from neighbouring Ulthar with the young priest Atal, who was his disciple.
__label__3 Her letter to Raymond gave no clue for discovery; it assured him, that she was in no danger of wanting the means of life; she promised in it to preserve herself, and some future day perhaps to present herself to him in a station not unworthy of her.

__label__3 Every breathing creature within the walls was massacred.
__label__3 "And my brother?" "Is on deck, Madam."
__label__3 I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.
__label__3 I signified my readiness to proceed, but our guides protested against such a measure.
__label__2 The rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of a vast band of terrorists, who on a designated day were to launch an orgy of slaughter for the extermination of America and of all the fine old traditions which The Street had loved.

__label__1 We had drawn the God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers.
__label__2 For a time Mercy could secure no more help, since the seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within five years' space, had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumour which later became so bizarre.

__label__1 And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the characters; and the characters were DESOLATION.
__label__3 The next evening therefore, though the autumnal change had brought on cold and rain, Adrian and Idris entered my cottage.
__label__1 My body was, but I had no breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot under my left ear which had the feel of a military stock I dare say that I should have experienced very little inconvenience.
__label__1 His sole thought is immediate escape.
__label__3 Besides, though the violence of her anguish made life hateful, it had not yet produced that monotonous, lethargic sense of changeless misery which for the most part produces suicide.

__label__2 And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.
__label__1 There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.
__label__3 This was not altogether the fact: but predominant self will assumed the arms and masque of callous feeling; and the haughty lady disdained to exhibit any token of the struggle she endured; while the slave of pride, she fancied that she sacrificed her happiness to immutable principle.

__label__2 The thing that lay half bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin.
__label__3 Thus in her twenty ninth year she died; having enjoyed some few years of the happiness of paradise, and sustaining a reverse to which her impatient spirit and affectionate disposition were unable to submit.
__label__2 I could not, I decided, risk an emergence into the corridor; where my footsteps would surely be heard, and where the difficulties of entering the desired room would be insuperable.
__label__1 "On Monday, one of the bargemen connected with the revenue service, saw a empty boat floating down the Seine.

__label__1 For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the city.
__label__1 I soon found that nearly all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of good humored anecdote in himself.
__label__1 But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.

__label__3 It evidently declined, without any symptom which could lead us to suspect his disease, unless indeed his brightened eyes, animated look, and flustering cheeks, made us dread consumption; but he was without pain or fear.
__label__2 About seven o'clock in the evening she had died, and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill West, whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life.
__label__1 For good reasons, however, I did my best to give the crowd the worth of their trouble.
__label__1 The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little while, pronounced her "a good hearted thing, rather indifferent looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar."
__label__3 Some unknown circumstance now induced his mother to send him from under her immediate tutelage; and we heard that he was about to visit Cumberland.
__label__2 "Yield up enough sacrifices an' savage knick knacks an' harbourage in the taown when they wanted it, an' they'd let well enough alone.
__label__3 We then conversed on the plan I should pursue, and discussed the probable means of discovering his residence.
__label__2 We boys used to overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odour of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders.
__label__3 The wretched female, loveless victim of vulgar brutality, had wandered to the toilet of high born beauty, and, arraying herself in the garb of splendour, had died before the mirror which reflected to herself alone her altered appearance.
__label__1 I grant you that in Fum Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis but, good heavens there is no competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all."

__label__3 His rank his least merit, do you say?
__label__1 He again took my arm, and we proceeded.
__label__1 Those who know any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion unless at a great distance from its suburbs.
__label__2 The Emma's men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the savage crew on the yacht's deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.
__label__3 I remembered in one of her harshest moments a quotation of mine had roused her to anger and disdain.
__label__1 This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race.
__label__2 Dr. Barnard, who had been watching the patient, thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality; and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening, as if of intelligent determination.

__label__1 The thought was too terrible to bear.
__label__1 Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again, if let alone.
__label__2 It was a simple, rambling thing a naive sailor's effort at a post facto diary and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage.
__label__3 "Every man," he said, "dreams about something, love, honour, and pleasure; you dream of friendship, and devote yourself to a maniac; well, if that be your vocation, doubtless you are in the right to follow it."
__label__3 I abhorred the face of man.
__label__2 "Common sense" in reflecting on these subjects, I assured my friend with some warmth, is merely a stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility.
__label__1 Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.
__label__3 Adrian led the troops.
__label__2 He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master's deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation.
__label__2 The scene I cannot describe I should faint if I tried it, for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things, with blood and lesser human debris almost ankle deep on the slimy floor, and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting, bubbling, and baking over a winking bluish green spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadows.
__label__3 There does not exist the man in England with adequate presumption.
__label__2 It was he who had given me all the information I had of Tillinghast after I was repulsed in rage.
__label__3 The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.

__label__2 No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.
__label__2 Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues.
__label__2 Then the lids opened, shewing eyes which were grey, calm, and alive, but still unintelligent and not even curious.
__label__2 The bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre, and I was looking at a large pillared hall on the right hand junction ahead.
__label__2 I was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort toward flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, voiceless monster held me.
__label__2 On this deep bony layer rested a knife of great size, obvious antiquity, and grotesque, ornate, and exotic design above which the debris was piled.
__label__1 Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the artist's wife's mother, but then I looked upon the whole address as a mystification, intended especially for myself.

__label__3 There were no degrees which could break my fall from happiness to misery; it was as the stroke of lightning sudden and entire.
__label__2 So, too, as we sailed the next day away from Holland to our home, we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background.

__label__3 I had expected some extravagant proposition, and remained silent awhile, collecting my thoughts that I might the better combat her fanciful scheme.

__label__3 Yet let me a little retract from this sentence I have passed on myself.
__label__2 A visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet.
__label__1 For some reason, he determined that nobody shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their representations, in a very singular manner.
__label__1 But these principles cannot be extended to the human organization, wherein there is a marked and radical difference in the construction, and, at all events, in the powers, of the right and left arms.
__label__3 I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created.
__label__2 Then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his calling by rousing and shaking his patient, and hurling at him a succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriol.
__label__3 England, seated far north in the turbid sea, now visits my dreams in the semblance of a vast and well manned ship, which mastered the winds and rode proudly over the waves.
__label__1 The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.

__label__1 For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin.

__label__2 Over the valley's rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapours that seemed to emanate from unheard of catacombs, and by its feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausolean facades; all crumbling, moss grown, and moisture stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation.

__label__1 One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it if such a thing wore possible even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.
__label__3 The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.

__label__1 Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.
__label__3 I acted then, as I ever must, from impulse.

__label__1 He, the Fly, was very little better than he should be.
__label__1 Proceeding, in the same direction, yet another thousand miles, I anticipate the rising by two hours another thousand, and I anticipate it by three hours, and so on, until I go entirely round the globe, and back to this spot, when, having gone twenty four thousand miles east, I anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less than twenty four hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your time.

__label__3 Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves sights which before always yielded me supreme delight so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.
__label__1 This prison like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.

__label__3 Besides that, with the nearly extinct race of man, all our toils grew near a conclusion, she was too weak; consumption, if so it might be called, or rather the over active life within her, which, as with Adrian, spent the vital oil in the early morning hours, deprived her limbs of strength.

__label__1 The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated.
__label__1 Each animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following, very quietly, in the wake of its master.

__label__1 He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn.
__label__1 Here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout.
__label__3 His demeanour was sad; for a moment he appeared glad to see me and then he checked himself as if unwilling to betray his feelings.
__label__1 The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged.

__label__3 A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.
__label__3 Never did any woman appear so entirely made of mind, as the Countess of Windsor.

__label__1 But my efforts were fruitless.
__label__2 Steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and looked about, stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced.
__label__3 I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.
__label__1 Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated.

__label__2 As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window, groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village, and joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain.
__label__3 "Elizabeth Lavenza "Geneva, May th, " This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend "I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT" Such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.

__label__2 The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm.

__label__2 Then thought trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than I had dreamed.
__label__1 Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted.

__label__1 "I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively.
__label__1 There had been nothing like order or arrangement.
__label__1 Mr. L l the student swooned.
__label__2 Then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried.
__label__2 My eyes, however, never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney; and I began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the woods outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall.
__label__2 The elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the Onga tribes near the field of his grandfather's and his own explorations, hoping in some way to account for Sir Wade's wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures.

__label__3 Cheers and loud acclamations followed the close of his speech.
__label__2 Meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of diabolic legendry.
__label__2 Springing to the floor, he washed and dressed in frantic haste, as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible.
__label__2 One canvas shewed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on Gallows Hill, whose dead face held a close kinship to theirs.

__label__2 What I saw was an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices; all of magnificent though unclassified architecture, and in various stages of preservation.
__label__3 At the turn of morning a gentle sigh from the patient attracted me, the burning spot on his cheek faded his pulse beat softly and regularly torpor yielded to sleep.
__label__1 When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel "Is the Automaton a pure machine or not?" his reply is invariably the same "I will say nothing about it."
__label__2 Many months passed, yet in the sour face of Musides came nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arouse.

__label__1 The water increased in transparency.
__label__3 The sky was blue above, and the air impregnated with fragrance by the rare flowers that grew among the weeds.
__label__2 And in the later watches of the night, when I went within the tower, I saw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when I had left it at the hour I sailed away.
__label__1 As night came on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive.

__label__3 "Is this your promised zeal?" "Pardon me," I said, "but even as you speak, I am gone."
__label__2 None of the non natives ever stayed out late at night, there being a widespread impression that it was not wise to do so.
__label__3 She refused with a smile, reminding him that for the present his sister had promised to be patient.

__label__1 And once but once again in the silence of the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying: "Sleep in peace for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora."
__label__1 During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell.
__label__2 I shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left.
__label__1 The lips were gently protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and repose.
__label__2 My liking for him did not grow, though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me.
__label__1 But he regarded me piteously with his large eyes and sighed.

__label__2 The man did not accost me, so I hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn father.
__label__1 The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly Decay.
__label__1 My father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many years at the summit of his profession, which was that of a merchant barber, in the city of Smug.
__label__3 Again he thought, how during this long month, he had avoided Perdita, flying from her as from the stings of his own conscience.
__label__2 It doesn't seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy.
__label__2 As to the nature of our studies must I say again that I no longer retain full comprehension?
__label__1 By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon Beauvais.
__label__1 At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats.

__label__1 A postscript, however, mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.
__label__3 At fourteen and fifteen I often thought that the time was come when I should commence my pilgrimage, which I had cheated my own mind into believing was my imperious duty: but a reluctance to quit my Aunt; a remorse for the grief which, I could not conceal from myself, I should occasion her for ever withheld me.
__label__2 Horrified, he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime.

__label__2 A swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight, and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapour.
__label__1 I regarded the sweet mouth.
__label__2 At the same time the wolfish wind rose to daemoniac crescendoes of ululation.
__label__2 We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted Crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with peculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible and opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair of military flame throwers of the sort used in the world war, in case it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction for like the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were prepared to burn the thing's heart out if heart existed to burn.

__label__3 He was not at the palace; and, though the attendants did not know whither he had gone, they did not expect him till late at night.

__label__3 I dared not die, but I might feign death, and thus escape from my comforters: they will believe me united to my father, and so indeed I shall be.
__label__3 In the open air alone I found relief; among nature's beauteous works, her God reassumed his attribute of benevolence, and again I could trust that he who built up the mountains, planted the forests, and poured out the rivers, would erect another state for lost humanity, where we might awaken again to our affections, our happiness, and our faith.

__label__2 Poor John His Son fared better, I think, and was made a Baronet.
__label__2 I thought of those very extreme Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centuried warrens near the waterfront.
__label__1 From the swarming streets to the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface.
__label__2 Fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up; and they were grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered to get rid of the thing quietly for a purpose I knew too well.
__label__2 And that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end; for upon the city in the valley I saw a pestilence descend, and then a frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left unburied only the temple of Artemis on the high peak, where the aged moon priestess Cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver head.
__label__1 "One" said the clock.

__label__1 I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.
__label__3 This determination soothed me.
__label__1 I could not be mistaken in its character.
__label__1 We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such.
__label__2 Immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it; that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave.
__label__3 Believe me, I was then less fitted for any communion with my fellow creatures than before.

__label__2 Out of the fungus ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse light, yellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in vague outlines half human and half monstrous, through which I could see the chimney and fireplace beyond.
__label__1 Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics.

__label__1 It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty one measures of oxygen, and seventy nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere.
__label__1 But my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage.
__label__1 In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques St. Eustache, and to him only, of her intent intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes.

__label__2 The landlord was in, and greeted him pleasantly.
__label__3 Little Evelyn had endeavoured to draw Clara away to play with him; but the Italian's tale arrested her, she crept near, her lustrous eyes fixed on the speaker.
__label__2 When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for the study.
__label__3 We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.
__label__1 Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit.

__label__1 He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick scull, sic a long purse, and a strong sense of his own consequence.
__label__3 I watched over my hasty temper, subdued my burning impatience of character, schooled my self engrossing thoughts, educating myself to the best perfection I might attain, that the fruit of my exertions might be his happiness.

__label__2 I thought, too, of those nameless swimmers I had seen.
__label__2 On each occasion investigation revealed nothing, and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination alone that same curiously disturbed imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the Holland churchyard.
__label__2 Then there was another our first whose exact fate we had never learned.
__label__1 This to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.
__label__2 I had read many scrolls out of Syria and Ægyptus, and the cryptic towns of Etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods bordering Lacus Nemorensis.
__label__1 He described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment.
__label__1 But when we consider the arrangement of the candles, another reason immediately presents itself.
__label__1 The public papers immediately took up the theme, and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations, when, one fine morning, after the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health, but with a somewhat saddened air, made her re appearance at her usual counter in the perfumery.
__label__2 I dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affected the watchman; but Romero was moving more swiftly now, and I followed without pausing.
__label__2 When the driver came out of the store I looked at him more carefully and tried to determine the source of my evil impression.
__label__3 If he were vanquished, I should be a free man.

__label__1 "Principally females, I presume?" "Oh, no every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell you."
__label__3 The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.
__label__3 Perdita had arrived with her child at Dartford, weeping and inconsolable.
__label__3 It was now deep winter; it had snowed, and was still snowing; the wind whistled in the leafless trees, despoiling them of the white flakes as they fell; its drear moaning, and the continued knocking, mingled wildly with my dreams at length I was wide awake; hastily dressing myself, I hurried to discover the cause of this disturbance, and to open my door to the unexpected visitor.
__label__3 Cherishing the most fervent hopes, embarked on the waste ocean, we saw with delight the receding shore of Britain, and on the wings of desire outspeeded our well filled sails towards the South.

__label__2 One night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint, lone campfires at great distances apart, and strange, shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders; and in the wildest part of this hilly country, so remote that few men could ever have seen it, he found a hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and valleys; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands, and of such a length that neither end of it could be seen.

__label__2 Subsequently many went to visit Kalos, and indeed noticed the pallor of his face; but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of Musides who was clearly distracted with anxiety, and who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own hands.

__label__2 And at last I resolved to scale that tower, fall though I might; since it were better to glimpse the sky and perish, than to live without ever beholding day.
__label__3 Raymond recognized her; and his manner changed from polite beneficence to the warmest protestations of kindness and sympathy.
__label__3 With all the energy of desperate grief I told him how I had fallen at once from bliss to misery; how that for me there was no joy, no hope; that death however bitter would be the welcome seal to all my pangs; death the skeleton was to be beautiful as love.

__label__3 I applied my glass, and could discern that the frigate had already cast anchor, fearful of the danger of approaching nearer to a lee shore: a boat was lowered; with a pang I saw that Raymond was unable to descend the vessel's side; he was let down in a chair, and lay wrapt in cloaks at the bottom of the boat.

__label__1 The day passed, and still he did not return.
__label__1 The vortex of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.
__label__2 He knew but a few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain.
__label__1 I felt that thus only should I look upon it such was the character of phantasm which it wore.
__label__1 In truth, it was a dream like and spirit soothing place, that venerable old town.
__label__3 Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.
__label__3 Then weeping, she clung to me: "Take me to him," she cried, "unkind Lionel, why do you keep me here?
__label__3 When we arrived, after a little rest, he led me over the house and pointed out to me the rooms which my mother had inhabited.
__label__2 Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long.

__label__1 And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well.
__label__1 The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.
__label__2 Leaning my cycle against the wall I opened the door at the left, and crossed into a small low ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way.
__label__3 This will I do, I said.
__label__2 When selecting the hill and building his mansion, Mynheer Martense had laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year; but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such phenomena.
__label__2 Then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten sea bottoms.
__label__1 The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.
__label__2 It is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates me, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building.

__label__1 While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob.

__label__1 AS it is well known that the 'wise men' came 'from the East,' and as Mr. Touch and go Bullet head came from the East, it follows that Mr. Bullet head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of the matter be needed, here we have it Mr. B. was an editor.

__label__1 We occasioned the greatest excitement on board all an excitement greatly relished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or fear, to the wind.
__label__2 I was not sufficiently awake to see whether Tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel, but felt a distinct anxiety on that score.
__label__3 First I must seek Adrian, and restore him to her.
__label__3 Not so Idris; her first glance was for her brother; she took his hand, she kissed his eye lids, and hung over him with looks of compassion and love.
__label__2 In about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky wall of the valley.
__label__2 And when they were come into the town they found rose wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies, who listened to the songs of Iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done.

__label__2 He stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand, since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming.
__label__2 The soft, stealthy, imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were unnerving.
__label__2 My uncle's face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours, and I recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream.
__label__1 I say "at will;" for the question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power.
__label__1 We soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident.
__label__2 Uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor.

__label__3 This appeared to him the primary step towards manhood, and he was proportionably pleased.
__label__3 Frankness and social feelings were the essence of Raymond's nature; without them his qualities became common place; without these to spread glory over his intercourse with Perdita, his vaunted exchange of a throne for her love, was as weak and empty as the rainbow hues which vanish when the sun is down.
__label__1 What shall we think of a machine which can not only accomplish all this, but actually print off its elaborate results, when obtained, without the slightest intervention of the intellect of man?
__label__1 There is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears.
__label__3 I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.
__label__3 The same half disdainful lips and smile of triumph, the same intelligent eyes, the same brow and chestnut hair; her very hands and taper fingers resembled his.
__label__3 We have watched over her; nursed her flickering existence; now she has fallen at once from youth to decrepitude, from health to immedicinable disease; even as we spend ourselves in struggles for her recovery, she dies; to all nations the voice goes forth, Hope is dead We are but mourners in the funeral train, and what immortal essence or perishable creation will refuse to make one in the sad procession that attends to its grave the dead comforter of humanity?
__label__3 We were set down at St. Bartholomew's, and entered the wretched precincts of the house of disease.

__label__3 But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it.
__label__2 This time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time, as the future would shew.
__label__3 We called to mind the plague of , when it was calculated that a third of mankind had been destroyed.

__label__1 It was deposited in Wyatt's own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife; this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor.
__label__1 Without pausing to speak of the "old saws," therefore, I shall content myself with a compendious account of some of the more "modern instances."
__label__1 This machinery is situated just beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is consequently easily reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his right arm brought across the breast.
__label__1 We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called "speaking terms," while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship.
__label__2 It had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes.
__label__1 In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.

__label__2 In the waning light of day I alternately rattled the rusty impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door, and essayed to squeeze my slight form through the space already provided; but neither plan met with success.
__label__1 But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture.
__label__1 The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.
__label__1 He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, "Yes, I wish to be.

__label__1 What I have heard has been at third or fourth hand."
__label__1 Having become satisfied of his identity, he took a bird's eye view of his whereabouts.
__label__3 "Yet," replied I, "nature always presents to our eyes the appearance of a patient: while there is an active principle in man which is capable of ruling fortune, and at least of tacking against the gale, till it in some mode conquers it."
__label__1 This canteen with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk.
__label__2 So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time.

__label__2 By what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible Holland churchyard?
__label__3 I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.
__label__1 This done, let us compare these communications, both as regards style and MS., with those sent to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais.
__label__3 I I alone was the cause of his defeat and justly did I pay the fearful penalty.
__label__1 Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel.

__label__3 But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.
__label__1 He grins when his daily work is done when his allotted labors are accomplished at night in his own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment.
__label__2 I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them.

__label__3 "Are you better now, sir?" said she.
__label__2 Obed finally got her married off by a trick to an Arkham feller as didn't suspect nothin'.
__label__3 I dare not hope that I have inspired you with sufficient interest that the thought of me, and the affection that I shall ever bear you, will soften your melancholy and decrease the bitterness of your tears.
__label__3 Nov. th It is only four o'clock; but it is winter and the sun has already set: there are no clouds in the clear, frosty sky to reflect its slant beams, but the air itself is tinged with a slight roseate colour which is again reflected on the snow that covers the ground.

__label__1 From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; from these paintings vivid as their images now are before me I would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words.

__label__3 I owe this to Greece, to you, to my surviving Perdita, and to myself, the victim of ambition."
__label__3 As he walked through the wretched streets in the neighbourhood of the luckless Greek's abode, his heart smote him for the whole course of his conduct towards her.
__label__3 Her timidity was not artificial, but arose from that fear of not being properly appreciated, that slight estimation of the neglect of the world, which also characterized Raymond.
__label__3 We had receded from the crowd; and ascending the steps of the terrace, sought the Castle.
__label__1 Now here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these communications themselves.
__label__1 But this, of course, cannot be done openly.
__label__1 The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld.
__label__1 And not only could such a thing do this, but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him should one of these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection he could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due.

__label__1 And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS.
__label__3 Her countenance was all expression; her eyes were not dark, but impenetrably deep; you seemed to discover space after space in their intellectual glance, and to feel that the soul which was their soul, comprehended an universe of thought in its ken.

__label__3 The effect of this scene of incantation communicated a portion of its power to that which followed.
__label__2 I cannot sleep at night now, and have to take opiates when it thunders.

__label__1 But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.
